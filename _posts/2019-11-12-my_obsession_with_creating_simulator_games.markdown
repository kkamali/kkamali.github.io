They are perhaps the silliest things I've created -- and also the things I'm most proud of. I was lucky enough to take part in two different VR hackathons, and for both I managed to find a group of people that would help me create my visions!

My first was *Project Human Simulator* a game where you were an alien, stuck in your human simulation suit in a grocery store -- desperately trying not to give away your cover. As is the case in both games I worked on, we had a silly movement mechanic to go along with our rampant physics engine shenanigans. You had to wiggle your arms around (one up, one down) and depending on how fast you wiggled was how fast you went. This game won my team "Most Novel Game", I'm still super proud of its silliness.

The second was *Ghost Simulator* a game where you were a ghost, trying to get a bunch of children out of your Gothic inspired house. The weird movement mechanic in this one was based on sound. You were meant to say "BOO" (though really any word worked) and how loud and how long determined how fast and how far you went.

I hope to continue making VR games in the future!
