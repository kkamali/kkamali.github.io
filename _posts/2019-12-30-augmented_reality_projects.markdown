While I personally don't gravitate towards using augmented reality in day-to-day life (let's be real, I pretty much immediately turned off AR in *Pokemon Go*) -- I've worked on one really cool project that I want to showcase that combines AR with 3D mapping. I focused on importing the 3D scan and used xcode and Apple's ARKit to make it seem like you're walking through the first Boeing 737. 

[Here's the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVgiHOmYqZc)

Fun fact: To test out the project (at about 4 or 5 in the morning) I used the halls of my apartment building and desperately hoped no one would see me walking around in my pajamas...
